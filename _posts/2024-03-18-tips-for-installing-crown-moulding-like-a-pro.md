## Tips for Installing Crown Moulding Like a Pro


Crown moulding adds an elegant finishing touch to any room, but perfecting those tricky angle cuts can be intimidating. Follow these tips from carpentry experts for clean, professional-looking results:

<ul>
<li> Measure Twice, Cut Once: Accurate measurement is key, so double check your measurements before making each cut.  </li>

<li> Mark Angles Clearly: Use a combination square or digital angle finder to clearly mark all angle cuts. This prevents cutting on the wrong side of your lines. </li>

<li> Make Test Cuts First: Practise angled cuts on scrap pieces until you're confident with your mitre saw setup and technique. </li>

<li> Hold Tight When Cutting: Clamp or weight down long pieces securely so they don't slip when cutting compound angles. </li>

<li> Use Backer Board: For cleaner cuts, cut against a straight edge like a piece of plywood underneath the crown moulding. </li>

<li> Stagger Joints: For strongest results, install crown moulding pieces so butted joints don't line up directly above one another on adjacent wall sections.  </li>

<li> Fill Gaps Perfectly: Use acrylic latex caulk in a small bead to fill any small gaps between pieces for an invisible seam. </li>
</ul>
