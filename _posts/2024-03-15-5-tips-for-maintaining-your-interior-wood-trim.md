## 5 Tips for Maintaining Your Interior Wood Trim



Wood trim adds beauty and character to any home, but it also requires regular upkeep to keep it looking its best. Over time, wood trim can fade, show wear and tear, or even develop cracks or splits. Here are a few tips to help maintain the wood trim inside your home:Â 

Dust regularly. Wood accumulates dust easily, so dusting your trim boards, baseboards, crown moulding, and wood doors helps prevent dirt and grime from building up. Dust at least once a week with a microfiber cloth.

Spot clean spills immediately. Don't let liquids sit on wood surfaces for long. Blot up any water, juice, or other spills right away with a dry cloth to prevent stains or scratches.

Apply protective finish as needed. Most interior wood has a clear protective finish like polyurethane or lacquer. If you notice the finish looking dull or worn, it's time to reapply. Sand lightly first if the old finish is flaking.

Inspect for damage regularly. Check the wood for nicks, dings, or cracks and make repairs promptly by puttying or restaining. Fixing issues early prevents further deterioration.

Consider professional refinishing every 5-10 years. For wood that gets a lot of wear and tear, or if you want to dramatically change the wood's colour or character, full professional refinishing is best. It protects and restores the wood for years to come.

With increasing demand for Carpenter jobs in Bath and surrounding areas due to homeowners making repairs and improvements to their homes, proper maintenance of interior wood trim is more important than ever.
