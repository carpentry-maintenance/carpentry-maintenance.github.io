## How to Waterproof Your Basement the Right Way


A damp, musty-smelling basement can really bring down the whole home. But with some carpentry skills and waterproofing materials, you can keep basement moisture at bay. Here are the key steps:

<ul>
<li> Install a Sump Pump - This pump removes any groundwater that seeps into the sump pit before it can accumulate. Run the pump discharge line at least 5 feet from the foundation. </li>

<li> Lay a Perimeter Drain - Trench around the exterior basement wall foundation and fill with gravel. Add perforated pipes at the base to capture water seeping through cracks. </li>

<li> Apply Waterproofing Membrane - Use self-adhered waterproofing sheets like bituthene on the exterior basement walls from footing to grade level. Apply in horizontal layers with seams overlapped. </li>

<li> Backfill Carefully - Once the membrane is installed, backfill the trench slowly and avoid damaging the membrane. Compact soil layers as you fill to prevent settling. </li>

<li> Install French Drains - French drains along the footing direct any residual water away from the structure to a lower drain outlet. Cover with landscape fabric before backfilling. </li>
</ul>
