## 3 Wood Floor Stains and How to Apply Them


Whether you're refinishing an old wood floor or putting the finishing touches on a new floor, choosing the right stain makes a big difference in the floor's overall look and feel. Here's an overview of 3 popular stain types for wood floors and how to apply each:

<ul>
<li> Oil-Based Stain: Oil-based stains are great for bringing out the natural grain in floors like oak or walnut. They penetrate deep for rich colour. Apply with a rag and allow to dry completely before adding a polyurethane topcoat.  </li>

<li> Water-Based Stain: These are safer and easier to work with than oil-based stains. Look best on closed-grained woods like pine or maple. Apply with a foam brush and let dry fully between coats of topcoat.  </li>

<li> Gel Stain: A hybrid stain that acts like an oil-based but cleans up with water. Ideal for busy families since it dries faster than oil. apply with a brush and wipe off excess for a satin finish. Let dry thoroughly before polyurethane topcoat. </li>
</ul>

With the growing demand for <a href="https://bpm-cs.co.uk/carpenter-jobs-in-bristol/"> Carpenter jobs in Bristol </a> and the South West region as more homeowners embark on DIY and renovation projects, knowing how to properly stain and maintain wood floors is invaluable.

Proper application is key to avoiding lap marks or uneven colouring. Work in small sections and maintain a wet edge as you go. Then follow with a polyurethane topcoat to protect the new stain job. With the right stain and technique, you'll love how your floors transform!
