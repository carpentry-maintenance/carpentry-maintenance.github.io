## Common Types of Wood and Their Uses


There are many varieties of wood used for different carpentry tasks. Knowing the best applications for common wood types ensures you select the right material for the job. Here are some essentials:

<ul>
<li> Pine – An inexpensive and lightweight softwood ideal for framing, sheathing, trim, and rough carpentry uses. Easy to work with. </li>

<li> Douglas Fir – A popular framing wood that is straighter-grained than pine for structural integrity. Also used for decking, fencing, millwork.  </li>

<li> Poplar – A hardwood that is lightweight, smooth-grained, and paints/stains well. Used for trim, furniture, panelling. </li>

<li> Oak – A very hard and dense wood that is durable and resists dents/dinks. Best for flooring, furniture, moulding, doors.  </li>

<li> Maple – A hard, close-grained wood perfect for flooring, countertops, and tabletops where a smooth surface is needed. </li>

<li>Cedar – Famed for its naturally decay- and insect-resistant qualities. Excellent for outdoor uses like decking, fences, shed siding. </li>

<li> Redwood – Similar to cedar, redwood is smooth-textured and hardy. Often used for outdoor projects and spacers. </li>
